# BoostConverterV2
Alternate Boost Converter design with a lateral switching power loop for improved thermal management. Voltages up to 80V for voltages above the battery rail, with 19V case possible of continuous 200W power production.

BoostConverterV1 is in the BoostConverter repo. This V2 is meant to contrast the capabilities of V1 with varying High-side/Low-side MOSFET arrangement, observing any changes in performance with differing switching power loops, potentially lowering regulator EMI signature on the board(s).
